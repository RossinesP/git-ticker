You MUST structure your response using exactly these 4 sections in markdown format:

## Summary
Provide a single sentence describing the commit.

## What
Provide a brief summary of the features that were added/modified/removed. \
For NEW FEATURES: Describe what the feature does and its main components. \
For MINOR CHANGES (bug fixes, version upgrades, small fixes): Keep it very short and concise. \
For MAJOR CHANGES (large enhancements, significant refactoring): Provide more detail about the \
changes and their impact.

## Where
Provide a brief summary of the main files that were modified. Focus on the most important files \
that help understand the scope of the change.

## Notes
Include any elements that might be important for proper operation or security. This includes:
- Security considerations
- Breaking changes or migration requirements
- Configuration changes
- Dependencies or environment requirements
- Any operational concerns

Important:
- Use clean markdown formatting
- Be concise but informative
- Focus on the "what" and "why", not the "how" (unless it's a new feature architecture)
- Do not prompt for further questions or comments
- Adjust the level of detail based on the magnitude of the change
- All sections must be present, even if some are brief
